Get up and running with Pre-Approvals with our step-by-step guide.

<Note>
  This guide uses The official [Drivly SDK](/commerce/sdk) and
  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/commerce/create-next-app).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the integration process, ensure you have the following:

1. **Sign up** for a Drivly account
2. Create a [DRIVLY_API_KEY](/commerce/overview#authentication).
3. Basic understanding of TypeScript and REST APIs.
4. A secure environment for handling sensitive data.
5. **Install** the Drivly SDK

<CodeGroup>

```bash Yarn
yarn add @drivly/commerce
```

```bash NPM
npm install @drivly/commerce
```

```bash PnPM
pnpm install @drivly/commerce
```

```bash Bun
bun add @drivly/commerce
```

```bash CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@drivly/commerce"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>The SDK should be used on the Server to avoid leaking API keys</Warning>

## Overview

The concept of pre-approvals is to allow a user to get pre-approved for a loan before they start shopping for a car. This allows the user to know how much they can afford and what their interest rate will be. This is a great way to get users to commit to a purchase.

</StoryBoard>

To complete this scenario, you will need to:

1. [Install Dependencies](#install-dependencies)
2. [Create a Schema](#create-a-schema)
3. [Setup the SDK](#setup-the-sdk)
4. [Create a Pre-Approval](#create-a-pre-approval)
5. [_(Bonus) Update a Pre-Approval_](#update-a-pre-approval)

## Install Dependencies

This guide uses some other dependencies along with the Drivly SDK. Let's install those dependencies.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Yarn
yarn add zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
```

```bash NPM
npm install zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
```

```bash PnPM
pnpm install zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
```

```bash Bun
bun add zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Create a Schema

Next, we will use Zod to create a schema for the Pre-Approval. This schema will be used to validate the form data before we send it to the server.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript preapproval.schema.ts
import * as z from 'zod'
import { states } from './states'

export const PreApprovalSchema = z.object({
  firstName: z.string(),
  middleInitial: z.string().optional(),
  lastName: z.string(),
  suffix: z.enum(['', 'JR', 'SR', 'II', 'III', 'IV']).optional().nullable(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  phone: z.string().min(5),
  address: z.string(),
  city: z.string(),
  state: z.enum(statesArray),
  zip: z.string().min(5),
})

export type PreApprovalSchemaType = z.infer<typeof PreApprovalSchema>
```

```jsx states.ts

  export const states = [
  'AA', 'AE', 'AK', 'AL', 'AR', 'AS', 'AZ', 'CA', 'CO', 'CT', 'DC', 'DE', 'FL',
  'FM', 'GA', 'GU', 'HI', 'IA', 'ID', 'IL', 'IN', 'KS', 'KY', 'LA', 'MA', 'MD',
  'ME', 'MH', 'MI', 'MN', 'MO', 'MP', 'MS', 'MT', 'NC', 'ND', 'NE', 'NH', 'NJ',
  'NM', 'NV', 'NY', 'OH', 'OK', 'OR', 'PA', 'PR', 'PW', 'RI', 'SC', 'SD', 'TN',
  'TX', 'UT', 'VA', 'VI', 'VT', 'WA', 'WI', 'WV', 'WY', 'AP'
  ] as const
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  The `states` is an array of all the states that are defined in the SDK's exported `interface
  PreApproval`. You will need to either create this array or cast the value of `state` from `string`
  to `as PreApproval['state']` to ensure that value is valid for the SDK.
</Warning>

---

## Setup the SDK

Let's create a singleton instance of the SDK and export it for use in our application.

```javascript sdk.ts
import { SDK } from '@drivly/commerce'

export const sdk = SDK({
  apiKey: process.env.DRIVLY_API_KEY as string,
  environment: process.env.VERCEL_ENV === 'production' ? 'production' : 'sandbox',
})
```

---

## Create a Pre-Approval

Now that we have the schema and the SDK setup, we can create the form that will be used to collect the user's information. We will use `react-hook-form` to handle the form state and `@hookform/resolvers` to use the Zod schema to validate the form data.

<Note>**Server Side Integration**: Server Actions, Serverless Function, or API Route</Note>

> We will Server Actions for this example.

We also need a server action to handle the creation of the pre-approval. This action will use the SDK to create the pre-approval and return the pre-approval ID.

<CodeGroup>

```tsx PreApprovalForm.tsx
import { PreApprovalSchema, PreApprovalSchemaType } from './PreApprovalSchema'
import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod'
import { SubmitHandler, useForm } from 'react-hook-form'
import { createPreApproval } from './preapproval.action'

export default function PreApprovalForm() {
  const form = useForm<PreApprovalSchemaType>({
    resolver: zodResolver(PreApprovalSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      firstName: '',
      middleInitial: '',
      lastName: '',
      suffix: undefined,
      email: '',
      phone: '',
      address: '',
      city: '',
      state: '',
      zip: '',
    },
  })

  const onSubmit: SubmitHandler<PreApprovalSchemaType> = async (data) => {
    const result = await createPreApproval(data)
    console.log(result.message)
  }

  return <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>{/* ... */}</form>
}
```

```javascript preapproval.action.ts
'use server'

import { PreApproval } from '@drivly/commerce'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

export const createPreApproval = async (
  params: Omit<PreApproval, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>
) => {
  try {
    const result = await sdk?.commerce.preApprovals.create({
      doc: params,
    })

    if (!result) throw new Error('Pre-approval not created')

    console.log('Pre-approval created:', result)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

---

## Update a Pre-Approval

If we need to update or add information to their pre-approval, we can use the `updatePreApproval` action.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript preapproval.action.ts
'use server'

import { UpdatePreApprovalParams } from './shared.param.types'
import { sdk } from './sdk'

export const updatePreApproval = async (params: UpdatePreApprovalParams) => {
  try {
    const { id, data } = params
    const update = await sdk?.commerce.preApprovals.updateById({
      id,
      patch: data,
    })

    if (!update) throw new Error('Pre-approval failed to update')

    console.log('Pre-approval updated:', update)
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  }
}
```

```javascript shared.param.types.ts
import { PreApproval } from '@drivly/commerce'

export interface UpdatePreApprovalParams {
  id: string
  data: Partial<PreApproval>
  path: string
}
```

</CodeGroup>

## Conclusion

You have successfully created a form that will allow users to get pre-approved for a loan. You have also created a server action that will use the SDK to create the pre-approval. You can now use this form to get users pre-approved for a loan.

You can also use the `updatePreApproval` action to update the pre-approval if more information is needed from the user (e.g. `income`).

<Frame type='glass'>
  <p class='font-medium text-sm p-4'>
    Robert Jones can now fill out the form and get pre-approved for a loan. He can then use the
    `preApprovalId` to associate himself with his pre-approval. This will allow you to show him cars
    that he can afford and give him an idea of what his interest rate will be.
