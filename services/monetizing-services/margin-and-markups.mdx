In car business - and especially in automotive services - markup is a common method for making money. But how do margin and markup differ, what options are available, and how can you manage it with Drivly?

- **Markup** is generally known as the amount an automotive business adds to the cost of a product or service to make up the final selling price so they can make money.

- **Margin** is generally known as the profit generated after accounting for costs.

Markup is shown as a percentage of _costs_ while margin is shown as a percentage of _revenue_. These two terms usually get confused as they both have similar inputs: what the service sold for and the cost of the service.

## Ordering Transportation

Let's look at an example to help clarify:

<StoryBoard>

Nathan, who is a developer, integrates Drivly's [Transport API](/services/transport-and-delivery/overview) into is his automotive retail business. A customer lands on his site and orders a transport for a 2020 **Audi A4** from Miami, FL **33132** (pick up location) to Austin, TX **78701** (delivery location).

</StoryBoard>

<br />

Nathan offers the transport service for **\$1,050** and it costs the transport provider **\$850** – so the difference is **\$200**.

- **Margin** would be calculated as \$200/\$1,050 = 19.05%
- **Markup** would be calculated as \$200/\$800 = 23.53%

Below is a visualization of the transaction flow:

## Ordering Vehicle Protection

Sometimes it can get confusing, so let's look at another example for Drivly's F&I products (they are amazing):

<StoryBoard>

Nathan, who is a developer, integrates Drivly's [VSC API](/services/finance-and-insurance/vehicle-service-contract/overview) into is his automotive retail business. A customer lands on his site and orders a transport for a 2020 **Audi A4** from Miami, FL **33132** (pick up location) to Austin, TX **78701** (delivery location).

</StoryBoard>

<br />

Nathan offers the transport service for **\$1,050** and it costs the transport provider **\$850** – so the difference is **\$200**.

- **Margin** would be calculated as \$200/\$1,050 = 19.05%
- **Markup** would be calculated as \$200/\$800 = 23.53%

Below is a visualization of the transaction flow:

For example, you could add 10% on long haul transportation from Florida to California if that's your most popular region or 15% on VSC products if most of your customers buy F&I products with their purchase, it's completely up to you!

## How do I add markup?

<StoryBoard>

> Can my customer see the markup?

> How do I add markup so the customer only sees one price?

</StoryBoard>

If you're integrating Drivly API's into your own app or website, you have control over exactly what the customer sees, so you can choose to show them whatever price you want. That could be the price that Drivly is charging you, more, or less.

Remember, some customers are more price sensitive than others....[add more]
