Get up and running with the Taxes & Fees API with our step-by-step guide.

Before you can get started with this guide, you'll need to:

1. [Sign up](https://www.driv.ly/signup) for a Drivly account
2. Create a [DRIVLY_API_KEY](/commerce/overview#authentication).
3. Basic understanding of REST APIs.
4. A secure environment for handling sensitive data.

  Our Taxes & Fees API empowers developers to provide customers accurate cost estimates based on
  location, credit score, and other factors. This walkthrough guides you through leveraging our API
  to make informed financial decisions in automotive sales.

<StoryBoard>
  When Sam decides to purchase a used Porsche 911, understanding the full scope of potential costs,
  including taxes, fees, and loan payments, becomes crucial.
</StoryBoard>

This guide will cover:

1. Making the API call
2. Processing the response
3. Presenting the results


<Steps>
  <Step title="Making the API Call">
    With the API key, craft a request to the endpoint with required parameters. 
    
    In this example, Sam is interested in a used car withVIN `WP0AF2A99KS165242` and lives in ZIP code `33132`. 
    
    Sam has a credit score of `720`.

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript taxes.js
const vin = 'WP0AF2A99KS165242'
const url = new URL(`https://taxes.vin/${vin}`)

const params = {
  zip: '33132',
  creditScore: '720',
}

url.search = new URLSearchParams(params).toString()

const headers = {
  Authorization: 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
}

fetch(url, { headers }).then((r) => r.json())
```

```python taxes.py

import requests

vin = "WP0AF2A99KS165242"

url = f"https://taxes.vin/{vin}" #

params = {
"zip": "33132",
"creditScore": "720",
}

headers = { "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
data = response.json()

```

```python taxes.py (async)

import aiohttp

vin = "WP0AF2A99KS165242"

url = f"https://taxes.vin/{vin}"

params = {
"zip": "33132",
"creditScore": "720",
}

headers = {
"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
}

async def main():
async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
async with session.get(url, params=params, headers=headers) as response:
data = await response.json()
print(data)

asyncio.run(main()) # Run the event loop using our main function

```

  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing the Response">
    After receiving the response, extract the necessary information to present the taxes, fees, and loan payment calculations to Sam.

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript taxes.js
const taxes = data.payments.taxes
const fees = data.payments.fees
const loanAmount = data.payments.loanAmount
const monthlyPayment = data.payments.loanMonthlyPayment
const monthlyPaymentWithTaxes = data.payments.loanMonthlyPaymentWithTaxes
```

```python taxes.py

taxes = data["payments"]["taxes"]
fees = data["payments"]["fees"]
loan_amount = data["payments"]["loanAmount"]
monthly_payment = data["payments"]["loanMonthlyPayment"]
monthly_payment_with_taxes = data["payments"]["loanMonthlyPaymentWithTaxes"]

```

  </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Presenting the Results">
    Present the taxes, fees, and loan payment calculations to Sam. Sam can now make an informed decision about the potential costs and loan payments for the vehicle.

  <CodeGroup>

```javascript taxes.js
console.log('Loan Amount:', loanAmount)
console.log('Monthly Payment (without taxes):', monthlyPayment)
console.log('Monthly Payment (with taxes):', monthlyPaymentWithTaxes)

console.log('\nTaxes:')
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(taxes)) {
  console.log(' ', key, ': $', value)
}

console.log('\nFees:')
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(fees)) {
  if (key === 'dmvFeesItemized') {
    console.log(' DMV Fees Itemized:')
    for (const dmvFee of value) {
      console.log(' ', dmvFee.name, ': $', dmvFee.value)
    }
  } else {
    console.log(' ', key, ': $', value)
  }
}
```

```python taxes.py

print(f"Loan Amount: ${loan_amount:.2f}")
print(f"Monthly Payment (without taxes): ${monthly_payment:.2f}")
print(f"Monthly Payment (with taxes): ${monthly_payment_with_taxes:.2f}")

print("\nTaxes:")
for key, value in taxes.items():
key_formatted = key.replace("SalesTax", " Sales Tax")
print(f" {key_formatted}: ${value:.2f}")
key_formatted = key.replace("SalesTax", " Sales Tax")
print(f" {key_formatted}: ${value:.2f}")

print("\nFees:")
for key, value in fees.items():
if key != "dmvFeesItemized":
print(f" {key}: ${value:.2f}")
if key != "dmvFeesItemized":
print(f" {key}: ${value:.2f}")

    else:
        print("  DMV Fees Itemized:")
        for dmv_fee in value:
            print(f"    {dmv_fee['name']}: ${dmv_fee['value']}")

```

  </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
</Steps>
