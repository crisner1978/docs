## Pricing

While we're in beta, access to the Photos CDN is free. We may introduce pricing in the future, but we'll give you plenty of notice before we do.

### Usage limits

Images are served from a global network of servers, and we don't impose any limits on the number of images you can serve. However, we do have a fair usage policy, and we may contact you if we notice any unusual usage patterns.

## Retail & Wholesale Photos

- **Retail Photos**: High-quality images sourced from dealerships, providing accurate representations of vehicles.
- **Wholesale Photos**: Images sourced from auctions such as Manheim and Adesa, offering a broader selection but with varying quality and accuracy.

<Note>`photos.vin` will provide access to both so you can decide which to use, and where.</Note>

## How to access the photos?

The photos are accessible via the `photos.vin` CDN, and the URL is constructed as follows:

```http Get all photos

This will return all photos for the VIN, including retail and wholesale photos.
