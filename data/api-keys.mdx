title: 'API Keys'
---

Drivly provides a unified API access mechanism for all of our data resources.

## Creating an API Key

To create an API key, navigate to [apikeys.do](https://apikeys.do/api) and click on the `"claim"` link. The UUIDv4 token will be given to you via the URL, and you can use it to authenticate your requests.

## Authenticating Requests

To authenticate your requests, you must include your API key in the `Authorization` header. The value of the `Authorization` header should be `Bearer <API_KEY>`, where `<API_KEY>` is your API key.

#### Query Parameter Authentication

You can also authenticate your requests by including your API key in the `apiKey` query parameter.

```http
GET https://taxes.vin/:vin?apiKey=your-api-key
```

## Rate limiting

While we're in beta, we're not enforcing rate limits. We do ask that you be respectful of our resources and not abuse the system.
