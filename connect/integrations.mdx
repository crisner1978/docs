Providers have different authentication flows. Some require a username and password, SSO, while others require an email address and password. Drivly supports the following provider types:

- `Google`, `Microsoft`, and `GitHub`
- `OAuth`
- `Email`
- `Email + Password`

The majority of providers are OAuth providers. These providers require a user to be redirected to a third party website to authenticate. Once authenticated, the user is redirected back to the link widget. The Email and Email + Password providers require a user to enter their email address and password into the link widget. This is then sent to Drivly and used to connect to the provider. 

The list of supported providers are as follows:
