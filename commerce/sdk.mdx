description: 'The official Drivly SDK for JavaScript, available for browsers and Node.js backends.'

## Installing

You can find our SDK on any of the following package managers or you can use our CDN to include it in your project.

<Note>
  Our SDK requires a minimum of Node.js 18 to work, or any modern browser. We rely on the Fetch API,
  so if you are using an older browser, you will need to use a polyfill. You can find out more
  information [here](https://caniuse.com/fetch).
</Note>

<CodeGroup>

```bash Yarn
yarn add @drivly/commerce
```

```bash NPM
npm install @drivly/commerce
```

```bash PnPM
pnpm install @drivly/commerce
```

```bash CDN
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@drivly/commerce"></script>
```

</CodeGroup>

## Getting started

You first need to create an API key, which you can find our documentation on [here](/commerce/overview#authentication). Please also read our [Best Practices](/commerce/best-practices) guide to learn how to best use our SDK.

```javascript
import { SDK } from '@drivly/commerce'

const sdk = new SDK({ apiKey: 'your-api-key', environment: 'sandbox' })
```

### Environment variables

If you wish to use environment variables, you can set the `DRIVLY_API_KEY` and `DRIVLY_ENV` variables in your environment. Our SDK will automatically pick up these environment variables and use them to authenticate your requests.

```bash
export DRIVLY_API_KEY=your-api-key
export DRIVLY_ENV=sandbox
```

## Making your first request

Now that you have your SDK set up, you can start making requests to our API. Here is an example of how you can get a list of consumers.

```javascript
const consumers = await sdk.consumers.find()
```

## Types

We also offer TypeScript types for our SDK, which you can use to get better type safety in your code. You can import the types like so:

```javascript
import type { Consumer } from '@drivly/commerce'
```

## Next steps

Now that you have our SDK set up, you can start using it to interact with our API. You can find our API reference [here](/commerce). If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at [support@driv.ly](mailto:support@driv.ly).
